# workspace
This is a workspace for ywang20 to store all c/cpp programming assignments in C-term 2017.
PA1, 2 are by ywang20 and others are by group mliu2-ywang20.

PA1:
  -PA1.c displays a twelve month calendar for an arbitrary year. Prompt the user for the year of the calendar, and print out          the calendar month by month, so that it looks like a real calendar.
  
  
PA2:
  -Game of Life. Accept as arguments the size of the board, the initial configuration, and the number of generations to play. Play that number of generations and display the final configuration of the board.
  
  
PA3:
  -PA3 is a program that can scan one or more text files and count the number of occurrences of each word in those files. Use a self-balancing binary tree to keep track of all of the words. When all input files have been scanned, print out a sorted list of the words to another file, along with the number of occurrences of each one. 
  
  
PA4:
  -Event-driven simulation of 2 bank model--common waiting list vs. each bank teller has a personal waiting list.
  
  
PA5:
  -Design and implement a rational number class, and have a test program to exercise that class. Overload the usual arithmetic operators to apply to objects of this class. Also overload the stream insertion and extraction operators (<< and >>) to read in and print out rational numbers.
